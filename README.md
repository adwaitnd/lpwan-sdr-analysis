# LPWAN SDR data analysis tools

This repo contains various tools that help with processing simulated or real physical layer data from LPWAN/LoRa transmissions

- *wireless_insite:* Tools to work with simulated data from Remcom's Wireless Insite EM simulation tool.
- *mf_upsampling:* Tools to work with captured SDR data. Utilities for applying matched filters and performing FFT upsampling on the results. Used to generate the plots in Chapter 5 of Adwait's thesis
